        <p>Hi! I'm Beatriz :)<br>I’m a philosophy grad student based in Lisbon, working at the intersection of philosophy of mathematics, cognition, and AI. My research focuses mainly on the limits of computation (human or artificial) and on how formal theories of logic and mathematics relate to real cognition.</p>

        <p>Since publishing my first paper at 21 (literature is my second passion!) and later joining the same journal as a reviewer, I became especially invested in the art of clear argumentation, careful writing, and collaborative academic work. These experiences deeply influenced my current projects and my big‑time goal of contributing to a more methodologically self‑aware cognitive science.</p>

        <p>On the Research page you'll find current projects and developing ideas that bridge technical work and conceptual analysis. I also included a Reading Recommendations page, where I collect papers and books that have been important for my thinking and that I often suggest to friends, students, and colleagues. If any of this overlaps with your interests—or if you'd like to discuss collaborations, RA work, or supervision—feel free to get in touch with me via the Contact page.</p>
