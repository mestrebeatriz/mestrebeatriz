								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								
								<p> Hi! My name is Beatriz and I am an MA student at University of Lisbon's School of Arts and Humanities. My focus is primarily in Philosophy of Mathematics, but I also dabble in Political Philosophy from time to time.
                  I recently received my BA in European Studies with a minor in European Philosophy, where I studied mainly Philosophy and History.
								I am currently working with Prof. Dr. Bruno Jacinto on Incompleteness and Provability (my thesis!)</p>
								<p> My research interest is in understanding how and why we know Mathematics, Incompleteness and Modal Logic. (to see my specific projects, please go to my Research tab). </p>
								I grew up in the deep southern interior of Portugal - yes, I have an accent!. I fell in love with Mathematics early on in my life (around 1st grade) and later with Philosophy. Outside of Mathematics and Philosophy, I'm a fan of iced lattes, literature and art.

								<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
								I am interested in the direct imaging of exoplanets, with the goal of understanding exoplanetary systems' orbital architecture formation and evolution.
								I use observational data on imaged planets' orbits and develop instrumentation techniques in order to improve our imaging capabilities in order to detect fainter and closer-in planets.
								Here, I wrote a small summary of what are my interests and what I am currently working on for research. You can find my co-authored publications below.

								<h3>Exoplanet Orbits & Dynamics</h3>

								<h4> Statistical Study of Planet Populations from Orbit Fitting </h4>

							<p> Using astrometry and radial velocitiy measurements of directly imaged exoplanets, it is possible to fit for these planets' orbits in order to constrain their orbital parameters. 
							However, many of these planets have long periods (10s-1000s of years long!), which means that we have a low phase coverage of their orbital arcs.
							This low coverage can lead to biases in their parameters from the orbit fits. 
							I used observable-based priors - a new approach to orbit fitting which aims to reduce the parameter bias in low phase coverage orbits - to analyze the eccentricity of exoplanets at a population level. 
							Understanding the eccentricity distributions of exoplanets can shed light on how they were formed. <b> This work has been published in The Astronomical Journal.</b> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/acdc9a">IOP</a> 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....166...48D/abstract">ADS</a> </p>

									<h4> High Resolution Spectroscopy to obtain Planet Radial Velocities </h4>

							<p> Radial velocities from high resolution spectroscopy are useful for eliminating degeneracies in orbit fitting, because they provide a third dimension of information to orbit fitting. In particular,
							they can remove the degeneracy between the longitude of ascending node (Ω) and the argument of periapsis (ω), as well as helping with the eccentricity-inclination degeneracy of orbits. 
								The companion to the 1RXS J034231.8+121622 system presented an unconstrained orbit fit.
							I used high resolution spectroscopy from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) and a new astrometric measurement from Keck/NIRC2 to re-calculate the system's mass and orbit, finding a better constrained orbit for the companion. 
							<b> This work has been published in The Astronomical Journal.</b> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad3df3">IOP</a> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240407742D/abstract">ADS</a> </p>

							<h4> Orbital Evolution of Exoplanet Systems </h4>

							<p> I investigated how young planetary system architectures evolve by simulating the future evolution of the PDS 70 system, which is an ideal testbed for this test due to its two confirmed wide super-Jupiters and gas disk.
								Using 2D hydrodynamic models combined with long-term N-body integrations, I followed how disk-driven migration, photoevaporation, and planet–planet interactions shaped the orbits of these wide-orbit super-Jupiters. 
								Once the disk dispersed, I tracked the planets’ gravitational evolution over billions of years and compared these results to disk-free N-body simulations based on current astrometry and radial velocities. 
								I found that long-term stability and maintenance of the current orbital architecture required the planets to be shepherded into a mean-motion resonance during the disk phase: without this disk-driven history, 
								only a small fraction of orbital configurations remained stable. 
								I also tested potential three-planet scenarios, showing that rapid disk dispersal led to instabilities within a few million years. <b> This work has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.</b>  
								<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11021">arXiv</a> 
								 </p>

						 <h4> The Roman Coronagraphic Instrument </h4>
								The Roman Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) is a pioneering high contrast imaging technology demonstration aboard NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, designed to demonstrate the technologies needed for future flagship missions that will directly image and characterize exo-Earths. 
								The CGI will push space-based contrast and stability to unprecedented levels, enabling the first reflected light detections and orbit refinements of a small set of giant planets. 
								I am focusing on identifying and prioritizing the best targets for these reflected-light observations using our current knowledge of exoplanet orbits and participating in the data reduction pipeline for the CGI. 
								This includes merging multiple simulation tools, modeling orbital detectability, and developing a framework that will guide the mission toward the most informative and feasible giant-planet observations.
		

						  <h3>High-Contrast Imaging Instrumentation</h3>
								


						   <h4> High-Contrast and Spectroscopy Testbed (HCST) for the Habitable Worlds Observatory </h4>
								<p> 
								The next NASA Flagship mission is the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which will have the capability of imaging Earth-like planets
								around Sun-like stars. This formidable goal requires a telescope design that allows us to image such faint objects so close
								to their stars (exo-Earths are about 10 billion times fainter than Sun-like stars, at a separation of about 1 λ/D at 10 parsecs away).
								At Caltech's ETLab, I am participating in the design and testing of low-order wavefront sensing systems that will allow us to
								achieve and maintain such high contrast levels at close separations in order to image exo-Earths with HWO.
								</p>
								
								<h4> GPI 2.0  </h4>
						    <p>Currently, many of our observations for exoplanet detection are ground based (our Telescopes are on Earth and not in space).
							    This means that the Earth's atmosphere can interfere on our images due to its turbulence.
							    The atmosphere severely limits the power of large telescopes, because it distorts the incoming light (called a wavefront), generating something called wavefront error.
							    This limitation led astronomers to develop a technology called adaptive optics (AO), which uses deformable mirrors to correct the turbulences introduced by the Earth's atmosphere (or correct for the wavefront error). 
							    The adaptive optics technology is constantly being improved, and is essential for ground based instruments that are searching for exoplanets. </p>
							<p> I worked on the upgrade of the Gemini Planet Imager's (GPI) wavefront sensor. The upgrade involves building and testing a pyramid wavefront sensor. 
								I have built the test source unit (TSU) for the wavefront sensor, which allowed us to test for the system's alignment. 
								I have also tested the wavefront sensor's detector, an EMCCD camera - checking for its noise contributors and overall functionality. GPI 2.0 will be installed at Gemini North. 
								These upgrades will allow us to find new exoplanets and to obtain high quality data on already known planets. 
								<b>I have an AO4ELT Proceeding on the test results for GPI 2.0's wavefront sensor EMCCD.</b> <a href="https://hal.science/AO4ELT7/hal-04419969">HAL</a>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06276">arXiv</a>  
							        <b>I also have an SPIE Proceeding on the test results to improve the wavefront sensor's camera image quality.</b> <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/13097/3019439/GPI-20--exploring-the-impact-of-different-readout-modes/10.1117/12.3019439.short">SPIE</a>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06276">arXiv</a>  </p>
